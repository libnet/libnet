I build from git using some scripts. General procedure is

    git clone https://github.com/libnet/libnet.git
    cd libnet
    scripts/Prepare
    scripts/Build

and then, one of the following, depending on how you like to install
local packages:

    sudo make install
    scripts/Stow
    scripts/Package
