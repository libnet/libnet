# Doxygen's man page generation is unfortunately very rudimentary.
#
# So in addition to creating the libnet(3) and the libnet-config(1) man page
# from two pod files, this (over-documented) script will also try to add a few 
# "finishing touches" to the two (or three or more) man pages generated by Doxygen.
#
# It will run after building libnet and after Doxygen generated all its
# documentations. If you ever have to run it manually, you should do the same.
# Apart from a few widely available GNU utilities, you'll also need pod2man
# (aka libpod-latex-perl) to get it to work.
